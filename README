A Matlab script to convert a noncommutative polynomial optimization problem to a sparse SDP problem that can be processed by the SDPA family of solvers. The optimization problem can be unconstrained or constrained by equalities and inequalities.

The objective is to be able to solve very large scale optimization problems. For example, a convergent series of lower bounds can be obtained for ground state problems with arbitrary Hamiltonians.

A usage example is included in example.m.

The code is based on the noncommutative example in Bermuja:

The code requires SeDuMi and Yalmip in the Matlab search path.

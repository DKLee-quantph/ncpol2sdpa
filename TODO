  - Improve documentation of solve_sdp, include the dictionary of solverparameters for each solver. Also document return values.
  - Circular symmetry of trace is not fully exploited for Hermitian variables.
  - Implement logging interface.
  - Start using unit testing and regression testing.
  - Support complex moment matrices in Picos and Mosek exports too.
  - Better support for steering hierarchy. Probably in a derived class.

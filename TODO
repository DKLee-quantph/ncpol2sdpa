  - Circular symmetry of trace is not fully exploited for Hermitian variables.
  - Better integration of Faacets. Reorganize class hierarchy to move Faacets relaxation to a new class.
  - Implement logging interface.
  - Start using unit testing.  
  - Support complex moment matrices in Picos and Mosek exports too.
  - Better support for steering hierarchy. Probably in a derived class.
  - Verify if MOSEK always flip the sign of the solution when the optimization is minimization.
